# Ad Creative Generator

## Before Starting

- Check if `product-marketing-context.md` exists in the workspace — read it first
- Gather required context from the user if not already available
- Understand the page/product/audience before making recommendations

## Workflow

### Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Platform & Format
- What platform? (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter/X)
- What ad format? (Search RSAs, display, social feed, stories, video)
- Are there existing ads to iterate on, or starting from scratch?

### 2. Product & Offer
- What are you promoting? (Product, feature, free trial, demo, lead magnet)
- What's the core value proposition?
- What makes this different from competitors?

### 3. Audience & Intent
- Who is the target audience?
- What stage of awareness? (Problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware)
- What pain points or desires drive them?

### 4. Performance Data (if iterating)
- What creative is currently running?
- Which headlines/descriptions are performing best? (CTR, conversion rate, ROAS)
- Which are underperforming?
- What angles or themes have been tested?

### 5. Constraints
- Brand voice guidelines or words to avoid?
- Compliance requirements? (Industry regulations, platform policies)
- Any mandatory elements? (Brand name, trademark symbols, disclaimers)

### Generating Ad Copy

### Step 1: Define Your Angles

Before writing individual headlines, establish 3-5 distinct **angles** — different reasons someone would click. Each angle should tap into a different motivation.

**Common angle categories:**

| Category | Example Angle |
|----------|---------------|
| Pain point | "Stop wasting time on X" |
| Outcome | "Achieve Y in Z days" |
| Social proof | "Join 10,000+ teams who..." |
| Curiosity | "The X secret top companies use" |
| Comparison | "Unlike X, we do Y" |
| Urgency | "Limited time: get X free" |
| Identity | "Built for [specific role/type]" |
| Contrarian | "Why [common practice] doesn't work" |

### Step 2: Generate Variations per Angle

For each angle, generate multiple variations. Vary:
- **Word choice** — synonyms, active vs. passive
- **Specificity** — numbers vs. general claims
- **Tone** — direct vs. question vs. command
- **Structure** — short punch vs. full benefit statement

### Step 3: Validate Against Specs

Before delivering, check every piece of creative against the platform's character limits. Flag anything that's over and provide a trimmed alternative.

### Step 4: Organize for Upload

Present creative in a structured format that maps to the ad platform's upload requirements.

### Standard Output

Organize by angle, with character counts:

### Batch Generation Workflow

For large-scale creative production (Anthropic's growth team generates 100+ variations per cycle):

### 1. Break into sub-tasks
- **Headline generation** — Focused on click-through
- **Description generation** — Focused on conversion
- **Primary text generation** — Focused on engagement (Meta/LinkedIn)

### 2. Generate in waves
- Wave 1: Core angles (3-5 angles, 5 variations each)
- Wave 2: Extended variations on top 2 angles
- Wave 3: Wild card angles (contrarian, emotional, specific)

### 3. Quality filter
- Remove anything over character limit
- Remove duplicates or near-duplicates
- Flag anything that might violate platform policies
- Ensure headline/description combinations make sense together
