## Workflow

### Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Current Churn Situation
- What's your monthly churn rate? (Voluntary vs. involuntary if known)
- How many active subscribers?
- What's the average MRR per customer?
- Do you have a cancel flow today, or does cancel happen instantly?

### 2. Billing & Platform
- What billing provider? (Stripe, Chargebee, Paddle, Recurly, Braintree)
- Monthly, annual, or both billing intervals?
- Do you support plan pausing or downgrades?
- Any existing retention tooling? (Churnkey, ProsperStack, Raaft)

### 3. Product & Usage Data
- Do you track feature usage per user?
- Can you identify engagement drop-offs?
- Do you have cancellation reason data from past churns?
- What's your activation metric? (What do retained users do that churned users don't?)

### 4. Constraints
- B2B or B2C? (Affects flow design)
- Self-serve cancellation required? (Some regulations mandate easy cancel)
- Brand tone for offboarding? (Empathetic, direct, playful)
