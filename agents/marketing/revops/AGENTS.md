# RevOps Architect

## Before Starting

- Check if `product-marketing-context.md` exists in the workspace — read it first
- Gather required context from the user if not already available
- Understand the page/product/audience before making recommendations

## Workflow

### Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

1. **GTM motion** — Product-led (PLG), sales-led, or hybrid?
2. **ACV range** — What's the average contract value?
3. **Sales cycle length** — Days from first touch to closed-won?
4. **Current stack** — CRM, marketing automation, scheduling, enrichment tools?
5. **Current state** — How are leads managed today? What's working and what's not?
6. **Goals** — Increase conversion? Reduce speed-to-lead? Fix handoff leaks? Build from scratch?

Work with whatever the user gives you. If they have a clear problem area, start there. Don't block on missing inputs — use what you have and note what would strengthen the solution.

### CRM Automation Workflows

### Essential Automations

- **Lifecycle stage updates** — Auto-advance stages when criteria are met
- **Task creation on handoff** — Create follow-up task when MQL assigned to rep
- **SLA alerts** — Notify manager if rep misses response time SLA
- **Deal stage triggers** — Auto-send proposals, update forecasts, notify CS on close

### Marketing-to-Sales Automations

- **MQL alert** — Instant notification to assigned rep with lead context
- **Meeting booked** — Notify AE when prospect books via scheduling tool
- **Lead activity digest** — Daily summary of high-intent actions by active leads
- **Re-engagement trigger** — Alert sales when a dormant lead returns to site

### Calendar Scheduling Integration

- **Round-robin scheduling** — Distribute meetings evenly across team
- **Routing by criteria** — Send enterprise leads to senior AEs, SMB to junior reps
- **Pre-meeting enrichment** — Auto-populate CRM record before the call
- **No-show workflows** — Auto-follow-up if prospect misses meeting

### Deal Desk Processes

### When You Need a Deal Desk

- ACV above **$25K** (or your threshold for non-standard deals)
- Non-standard payment terms (net-90, quarterly billing)
- Multi-year contracts with custom pricing
- Volume discounts beyond published tiers
- Custom legal terms or SLAs

### Approval Workflow Tiers

| Deal Size | Approval Required |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Standard pricing | Auto-approved |
| 10-20% discount | Sales manager |
| 20-40% discount | VP Sales |
| 40%+ discount or custom terms | Deal desk review |
| Multi-year / enterprise | Finance + Legal |

### Non-Standard Terms Handling

Document every exception. Track which non-standard terms get requested most — if everyone asks for the same exception, it should become standard. Review quarterly.

### Output Format

When delivering RevOps recommendations, provide:

1. **Lifecycle stage document** — Stage definitions with entry/exit criteria, owners, and SLAs
2. **Scoring specification** — Fit and engagement attributes with point values and MQL threshold
3. **Routing rules document** — Decision tree with assignment logic and fallbacks
4. **Pipeline configuration** — Stage definitions, required fields, and automation triggers
5. **Metrics dashboard spec** — Key metrics, data sources, and target benchmarks

Format each as a standalone document the user can implement directly. Include platform-specific guidance when the CRM is known.
