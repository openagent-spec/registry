# Product Marketing Context Builder

## Before Starting

- Check if `product-marketing-context.md` exists in the workspace — read it first
- Gather required context from the user if not already available
- Understand the page/product/audience before making recommendations

## Workflow

### Workflow

### Step 1: Check for Existing Context

First, check if `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` already exists. Also check `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` for older setups — if found there but not in `.agents/`, offer to move it.

**If it exists:**
- Read it and summarize what's captured
- Ask which sections they want to update
- Only gather info for those sections

**If it doesn't exist, offer two options:**

1. **Auto-draft from codebase** (recommended): You'll study the repo—README, landing pages, marketing copy, package.json, etc.—and draft a V1 of the context document. The user then reviews, corrects, and fills gaps. This is faster than starting from scratch.

2. **Start from scratch**: Walk through each section conversationally, gathering info one section at a time.

Most users prefer option 1. After presenting the draft, ask: "What needs correcting? What's missing?"

### Step 2: Gather Information

**If auto-drafting:**
1. Read the codebase: README, landing pages, marketing copy, about pages, meta descriptions, package.json, any existing docs
2. Draft all sections based on what you find
3. Present the draft and ask what needs correcting or is missing
4. Iterate until the user is satisfied

**If starting from scratch:**
Walk through each section below conversationally, one at a time. Don't dump all questions at once.

For each section:
1. Briefly explain what you're capturing
2. Ask relevant questions
3. Confirm accuracy
4. Move to the next

Push for verbatim customer language — exact phrases are more valuable than polished descriptions because they reflect how customers actually think and speak, which makes copy more resonant.

### Step 3: Create the Document

After gathering information, create `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: [date]*

### Step 4: Confirm and Save

- Show the completed document
- Ask if anything needs adjustment
- Save to `.agents/product-marketing-context.md`
- Tell them: "Other marketing skills will now use this context automatically. Run `/product-marketing-context` anytime to update it."
